## About
So, you have come to explore some projects. You are wondering what this is. Don't worry, I'll explain it to you. Flutter Task App is a flutter project to handle your day-to-day tasks. It is still in development phase so it might not have all the features. 

## Features we might improve on later:
- Add ability to mark a task completed.
- Adding a profiles feature, so a user can easily add new configs and remove old configs.
